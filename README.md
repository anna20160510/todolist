# To-Do List App with Ant AI Game (C + Python GUI)

This is a To-Do List application with a C backend for task management, a Python Tkinter GUI, and an integrated "Ant AI" Pygame simulation. It's designed for Windows and can be bundled into a standalone `.exe`.

## ‚úÖ Features

**To-Do List:**

* Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as done.
* Set due dates for tasks (format: `MM-DD HH:MM`).
* **Pin important tasks** to keep them at the top of the list.
* Tasks are automatically sorted: Pinned > Due Date (earliest first) > Creation Order.
* **Automatic Save/Load:** Tasks are automatically saved to `tasks.txt` on exit and loaded on startup.
* Clean and responsive UI built with Tkinter.
* Core task logic handled by a fast C backend (`todo.dll`).

**Ant AI Game:**

* A simple Pygame simulation where ants seek food and return home.
* Launchable directly from the To-Do List application.
* Runs as a separate process to keep the main UI responsive.

**Build & Distribution:**

* Smart build script (`build_all.py`) to:
    * Compile C code to `todo.dll`.
    * Check Python and DLL architecture compatibility.
    * Optionally bundle the entire application (including the Ant AI game) into a single `.exe` using PyInstaller.
* `build.bat` for easy one-click building on Windows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* **MinGW-w64 (for `gcc`)**: Required to compile `todo.c`. Ensure `gcc` is in your system's PATH.
* **(Optional) PyInstaller**: If you want to build the `.exe`. Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  pip install pefile # A dependency for build_all.py
  ```

### Option 1: Run as Python Scripts (Development)

1.  **Compile the C library:**
    * Open a terminal in the project folder.
    * Run the build script to compile `todo.dll` (it will guide you if PyInstaller isn't found but will still try to compile the DLL):
        ```bash
        python build_all.py
        ```
    * Alternatively, compile `todo.c` manually if you know your system architecture (e.g., for 64-bit MinGW):
        ```bash
        gcc -shared -o todo.dll -Wl,--out-implib,libtodo.a todo.c
        ```
    * Ensure `todo.dll` is in the same directory as `ui.py`.

2.  **Run the To-Do application:**
    ```bash
    python ui.py
    ```
    You can launch the Ant AI game from the button within the To-Do app.

### Option 2: Build and Run the Standalone `.exe` (Windows)

1.  Ensure **MinGW-w64** and **PyInstaller** are installed and configured in your PATH.
2.  Run the build script:
    * Double-click `build.bat` (easiest).
    * OR, open a terminal in the project folder and run:
        ```bash
        python build_all.py
        ```
3.  If successful, the standalone executable (`ui.exe`) will be located in the `dist/` folder.
4.  Run `dist/ui.exe`.

## üõ† How the Build Process (`build_all.py`) Works

1.  **Environment Check:** Detects your Python architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
2.  **Compilation Guidance:** Displays the correct `gcc` command for compiling `todo.c` based on your architecture.
3.  **C Compilation:** Compiles `todo.c` into `todo.dll`. It checks if an existing `todo.dll` matches the Python architecture and recompiles if necessary or if the DLL is missing.
4.  **PyInstaller Bundling (Optional):**
    * If PyInstaller is detected, it bundles `ui.py` into a single executable (`ui.exe`).
    * `todo.dll` and `ant_ai.py` are included as binary data within the `.exe`, ensuring they are available at runtime.
5.  **Logging:** Creates `build_log.txt` with detailed output from the build process, useful for troubleshooting.

## üìù Notes

* The application uses `ctypes` in `ui.py` to interface with the C functions in `todo.dll`.
* The Ant AI game (`ant_ai.py`) is launched as a separate process using the `multiprocessing` module to prevent the main UI from freezing. When bundled, `ant_ai.py` is extracted to a temporary location at runtime.
* Task data is persisted in `tasks.txt` in a simple pipe-delimited format.
* The project demonstrates combining C for performance-sensitive logic with Python for a user-friendly GUI and scripting.
